## Changes made to the car model (`tools/build-car.mjs`)

- Shape, UVs, plate and badge artwork are unchanged.
- The 544 loose meshes are merged into named parts: `body`, `wheel0`-`wheel3`, `interior`, a lighter `interiorLo` for outside views, and `steer` (the steering wheel, cut out so it can turn).
- Rescaled to metres, nose towards -z, wheels on the ground; textures re-encoded as WebP; geometry Draco-compressed.
- In the game only the body paint colour is set per car (gold, blue, red). Glass, wheels, carbon, lights and the cabin are shared and not tinted.

Road, markings, START/FINISH, boost pads, guard rails, skyline towers, obstacles and particles are generated in code (`tools/r3d.js`).
